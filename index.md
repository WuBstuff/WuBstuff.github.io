### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    This lab was also interesting, specifically part 2 of it. It was a repeat of the blackjack game from lab 5 but instead we had to utilize vectors. The code was long compared to the other lab parts, but we completed it through the instructions. This was also a refresher that there is more than one way to write code that can do the same thing. Since they both play a blackjack game, we referenced the older code and used it to integrate vectors into it which helped. This also made me realize that in coding, we have so many resources that we can refer to that can help us in our journey.
