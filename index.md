### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    This lab was also interesting, specifically part 2 of it. It was a repeat of the blackjack game from lab 5 but instead we had to utilize vectors. The code was long compared to the other lab parts, but we completed it through the instructions. This was also a refresher that there is more than one way to write code that can do the same thing. Since they both play a blackjack game, we referenced the older code and used it to integrate vectors into it which helped. This also made me realize that in coding, we have so many resources that we can refer to that can help us in our journey. 

* Lab 5
    This was the first lab where I had partners, and overall, it was a helpful experience. Instead of trying to problem solve myself, I had help from two other people who were also looking at the problem but thinking differently. I loved the part 3 of this lab which was the blackjack game. At first, I oversimplified the prompt and later realized the solution was much easier. This lab taught me how simple the solutions can be and to just take a step at a time. 
    
* Lab 3
    I personally enjoyed lab 3 because it was the lab that made me fully realize how perfect the code needed to be written. Not only that but it was a lot of trial and error for me on part 3 of the lab which was the hi and low game. I understood what the prompt wanted but I ended up spending hours of my time writing it because after I got the game to run, Iâ€™d realize the errors when running the program. Although it was very time consuming, it was a fun challenge that I enjoyed spending hours solving.
